## Where?

Recently moved from [Federal Way](https://www.cityoffederalway.com), a suburb between Seattle and Tacoma, to [Tucson](https://www.visittucson.org), in Arizona's Sonora Desert. This has been an interesting shift after living in the Puget Sound area most of my life.

We agreed it was time for a *major* change, for a lot of reasons. Biggest two boil down to cost of living and the inevitable changes of an area over decades. I love Seattle and I've missed it since the day we moved to the suburbs a few years ago, but the Seattle in my mind? With Sit 'n' Spin, art theaters, and a general inclination towards letting California have all the billionaires? That city hasn't existed for a long time.

## With who?

Let's see. There are four humans and four critters. I am happily married to [one of](https://hackers.town/@IamMrsGeek) the humans. The other two are pretty cool.

The critters? Two dogs, two cats.
