Portable user setting configurations, in a literate programming style. Driven by [Yarner]({{< relref "/card/yarner.md" >}}) and [[inbox.dotbot]].

I'm not 100% sure about the added wrinkle of storing all this in an [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}) vault, but it's an interesting idea at least.

First stop is the [Justfile]({{< relref "/config/justfile.md" >}}).
