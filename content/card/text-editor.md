An application that lets you work with just about any [Programming Language]({{< relref "/card/programming-language.md" >}}) or [Lightweight Text Formatting Language]({{< relref "/card/lightweight-text-formatting-language.md" >}}).

As a geek, your text editor is your most important tool. Pick one or two, and really get to know it. I donâ€™t care if you choose [Emacs]({{< relref "/card/emacs.md" >}}), [Vim]({{< relref "/card/vim.md" >}}), [Visual Studio Code]({{< relref "/card/vs-code.md" >}}), or whatever else. Learn how to use it. I want you to *really* get the hang of your editing environment. Being more skilled with your tools will make it easier for you to get work done. And geek play, of course.
