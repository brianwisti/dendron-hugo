Statically typed [Programming Language]({{< relref "/card/programming-language.md" >}}) with syntax inspired by [Ruby]({{< relref "/card/ruby/_index.md" >}}).

Comfortably straightforward to [install Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) on most major platforms, except Windows native is still in preview.
