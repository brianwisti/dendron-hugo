A [Static Site Generator]({{< relref "/card/static-site-generator.md" >}}) written in [Ruby]({{< relref "/card/ruby/_index.md" >}}).

Rule-based, where instead of just dropping some Markdown files in a predefined folder, you apply rules, filters, and helpers to handle how source files become a Web site.
