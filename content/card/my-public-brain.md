An attempt at sharing my notes online.

<!--more-->

Like a more freeform version of what I did with [Coolnamehere]({{< relref "/card/coolnamehere.md" >}}). Mental friction of maintaining multiple sites resulted in me taking it down before it started to rot.

I liked the idea though, and shifted the angle into making my [PKM]({{< relref "/card/pkm.md" >}}) the [CMS]({{< relref "/card/cms.md" >}}) for [Random Geekery]({{< relref "/card/random-geekery.md" >}}). I imported the posts into a new [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}) vault, and refactored â€“ extracting note cards from recurring topics, refactoring or removing some posts that no longer felt right as blog posts.

The note cards start out pretty raw, but that's okay. I fill them out with details from other PKM resources or fresh lookups as I need them.

Still ironing out the details of publishing the new hybrid site, but it currently involves [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}), [obsidian-export]({{< relref "/card/obsidian-export.md" >}}), and some support scripts.
