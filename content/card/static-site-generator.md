Takes some source content — usually something in a [Lightweight Text Formatting Language]({{< relref "/card/lightweight-text-formatting-language.md" >}}) — and generates a Web site. This gives you consistent appearance and behavior throughout that site without requiring interaction from a server.

"Static" is a little misleading these days, as a lot of generators give you a *Jamstack* application. These get dynamic behavior through JavaScript, and often additional functionality by interacting with APIs and serverless endpoints.

Static site generation is one of my special interests, so there's a disproportionate amount of material here about it.
