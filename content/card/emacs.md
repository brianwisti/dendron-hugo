More than a text editor, it's a lifestyle.

> Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.

Okay, so what are the main tasks I use Emacs for?

- Editing text files of course, including but not limited to:
  - Notes and task management via [Org]({{< relref "/card/org.md" >}})
  - Source code for Ruby, Perl, Python, LISP, and JavaScript projects
- The scratch buffer makes a handy calculator, since it can evaluate LISP code.

My main advice to you if you want to use Emacs: do more than just edit text with it. Use it as a calculator. Let it handle your email. Play Tetris with it. Experiment and have a little fun.

What’s that? "Play Tetris with it?" Yes, that’s right. I said "Tetris".
`M-x tetris` and see for yourself.
