I'm Brian, and this is my site.

## About the site

[Random Geekery]({{< relref "/card/random-geekery.md" >}}) is a personal blog and note collection, and has served in one or both capacities since 2013. Whenever you happen to be looking at it, it was probably built with a [Static Site Generator]({{< relref "/card/static-site-generator.md" >}}). Depending on what iteration the content is at, there may be a lot of [PKM]({{< relref "/card/pkm.md" >}}) notes.

## About me

I'm Brian Wisti, a geeky middle-aged white dude living in Tucson Arizona. I write code for pay and as a hobby, usually with open source tools. I also draw and knit when my brain lets me. I am also known in some spots as Random Geek. If you detect a subtext of [ADHD]({{< relref "/card/adhd.md" >}}) then you are very wise.

Though you can [Follow]({{< relref "/slash/follow.md" >}}) me on any number of social media networks, I run counter to type on one aspect of the terminally online: I've only got the one site. Everything I want to last will either start here or end up here eventually. Not only that, but it directly followed my previous [Coolnamehere]({{< relref "/card/coolnamehere.md" >}}) and includes most of its content. You can trace a direct — if somewhat wobbly — line for my online existence from 2000 to the present via the pages on this site.
