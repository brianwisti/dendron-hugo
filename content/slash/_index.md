Information I want to share specifically in this site's context.

<!--more-->

The site you're looking at now — the combined bulk of [Random Geekery]({{< relref "/card/random-geekery.md" >}}) and [My Public Brain]({{< relref "/card/my-public-brain.md" >}}) — should tell you more than you ever want to know about me, but often there are details and contexts that get lost in all the blog posts and PKM cards. These pages provide some of those details and contexts.
