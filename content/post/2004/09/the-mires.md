Okay, here’s the plan. Every couple of weeks I will try to think of one interesting thing to do with Ruby. I will then proceed to actually *do* this interesting thing, recording my progress as I move along. Then I will compile my notes from the recorded progress and turn them into a brief tutorial on how you, the Esteemed Reader, can accomplish the same task. Now, what is interesting to me may be mind-numbingly boring or childishly simple for you. It isn’t likely that *everybody* will feel the love for this section of the site. That’s okay, though, because I am largely doing this as part of my own efforts to deepen my understanding of the Ruby language.
