## Introduction

If you have never programmed before in your life, then do I have the perfect programming language for you. It's called [Python]({{< relref "/card/python.md" >}}). It is easy to learn, flexible, and loaded with capabilities that you never thought would be so easy to use. Imagine your thrill when you write a complete program in just a few lines!

If you have spent years programming Perl, and are just about sick of all of the weird little context dependencies ("My function does this when you hand it a single object, and that when you hand it a list, unless you are assigning the result to a list, in which case it does this other thing"), then do I have the perfect language for you. It's called Python. It has clear, unambigous syntax, and it is simple to create your own modules and objects. Imagine your thrill when you write a complete program in just a few lines, and somebody else can read it!

This is a tutorial to help the non-programmer learn the basics of using Python. When you are done with it, you will be ready to learn this new language, and have no problems figuring out where to find the information you need to go farther.

[Python tutorial]: http://docs.python.org/tutorial

Experienced programmers may get some small value out of this, too, but you will get bored quickly. I am aiming for simplicity, rather than rigid accuracy. There is always the official [Python tutorial][] to provide an introduction for veterans.

If anybody has any suggestions or comments about this tutorial, please let me know!

I hope you enjoy this!
