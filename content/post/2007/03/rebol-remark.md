I haven't been on the [Rebol]({{< relref "/card/rebol.md" >}}) [AltME](http://www.altme.com/) world for a few weeks, mainly because AltME isn't working correctly on Linux. The only time I log on is on my OS X machine if I remember or on Windows via VMWare if I'm not too busy. Turns out that Maxim (<https://pointillistic.com>, I think) left a message for me that [reMark](http://www.pointillistic.com/open-REBOL/moa/steel/retools/remark/index.html) is available for messing with. I think the idea is that you can use reMark to build static Web sites, very similar to the way that [WebMake](http://webmake.taint.org/) or [ZenWeb](http://zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenWeb/index.html) do. This is REBOL, of course, so the approach is going to be a bit different.

I will be experimenting with reMark over the next few days/weeks to see what I can do with it. You can too, but remember that it is alpha and Maxim might be a little busy to do intense development on it.
