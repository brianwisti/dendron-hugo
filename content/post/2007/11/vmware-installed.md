Okay, now I feel good. I've got [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/) installed with Windows XP as the guest OS. That means Office and who knows how many other apps are readily accessible for me. [Rebol]({{< relref "/card/rebol.md" >}}), for starters. It's supposed to be cross-platform, but REBOL is happiest by far under Windows.

Incidental anecdotal comment: Windows XP running with 512 MB of RAM in a virtual machine is still significantly snappier than a "real" install of Vista and 2 GB of RAM. And I had turned most of the Vista eye candy off before getting fed up and installing Fedora.
