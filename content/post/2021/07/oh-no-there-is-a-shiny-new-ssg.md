Saw [Astro]({{< relref "/card/astro.md" >}}) mentioned in my Twitter feed today. Tempting.

Been looking for a gateway SSG into JavaScript. Something with a little more built-in than [Eleventy]({{< relref "/card/eleventy.md" >}}), but maybe a bit less than [Gatsby]({{< relref "/card/gatsby.md" >}}). I think I'll play with Astro â€” see if it keeps my attention.

Will it keep my attention long enough to replace the Hugo version? Precedent says "no." But it should be fun just the same.
