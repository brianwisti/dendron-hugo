John Gruber, the creator of [Markdown]({{< relref "/card/markdown.md" >}}), [commenting](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/05/snell-ios-markdown-editors) on Markdown editors and their trend towards hiding the syntax:

> Maybe I donâ€™t know much about Markdown, but my understanding is that the whole point of it is to provide a syntax where the most common HTML tags for prose can be replaced by simple punctuation characters that are meant to be visible to the writer.
