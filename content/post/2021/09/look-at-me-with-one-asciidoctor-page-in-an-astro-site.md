I wanted [Asciidoctor]({{< relref "/card/asciidoctor.md" >}}) in [Astro]({{< relref "/card/astro.md" >}}). It took some fiddling, but not as much
as expected. It's a good start.

I won't bore you with the details. Maybe later when there are more details to bore you with.

Now for the other 600 pages.
