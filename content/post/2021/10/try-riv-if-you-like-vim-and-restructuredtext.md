[Riv](https://github.com/gu-fan/riv.vim) is a wiki, but feels like more of a notebook. Think [Deft for Emacs](https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) with journaling and HTML publishing. What makes Riv interesting — aside from the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) thing — is that it uses [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) for its native format.

It works well enough, especially once you build up muscle memory for Riv's leader sequence <kbd>C-e</kbd>. Don't overload it right away though! It includes some insert mode mappings, which can get real confusing if your preferred leader is a space.

Meanwhile I got a lot of [Neovim]({{< relref "/card/neovim.md" >}}) ideas. Course, I need to get some more practice in with [pynvim](https://pynvim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) first. And I suppose some more practice with Riv.
