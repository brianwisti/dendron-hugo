Would you look at that? We got some actual weather.

What else?

Been keeping myself busy with the JavaScript static site generators. Last week's [Astro]({{< relref "/card/astro.md" >}}) experiment got slow so I've been messing with [Eleventy]({{< relref "/card/eleventy.md" >}}).

Probably my last note of the year, so: Happy New Year!
