![Pair of socks with off-white and gray coloring](assets/img/2021/cover-2021-01-01.jpg "blocked and ready to wear")

Took me six months to make these. Itâ€™s a good thing she likes them!

# The pattern

Using [Sensational Knitted Socks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399836.Sensational_Knitted_Socks) by Charlene Schurch, as usual.
Been a while since I knitted any socks, so I went with a safe [moss
stitch](https://www.gathered.how/knitting-and-crochet/knitting/moss-stitch/) fallback.

# The yarn

brand
: Think Bamboo

style
: B917

color
: 992

composition
: 45% bamboo, 40% wool, 15% nylon

site
: <https://thinkbamboo.com>; doesn't work for me at the moment

The yarn is pretty, and works nice once you get going.  It is beyond a hassle
to wind up, though.
