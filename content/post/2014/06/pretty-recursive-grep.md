<!--more-->

I'm looking for TODO entries in source code on a machine that does not have Ack installed. It does have [GNU grep](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/), though.

Obviously I want to search subdirectories. I can choose between `--recursive`, `-R`, or using `rgrep` on this particular machine.

I am usually searching through source code. I hardly ever want binary files to match. That means `--binary-file=without-match`  or `-I`.

Finally, I like pretty colors. The `--color=auto` option makes me happy.

That leaves me with this invocation.

``` console
grep --recursive --binary-file=without-match --color=auto 'TODO' .
```

Or maybe the short form would be easier.

``` console
rgrep -I --color=auto 'TODO' .
```

Probably smartest to look at what [environment variables](http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/html_node/Environment-Variables.html) I could set up in order to skip remembering this stuff at all.

``` bash
export GREP_OPTIONS='-RI --color=auto'
```

Pop that in my `.bashrc` and I'm set.

``` console
grep 'TODO' .
```

All right. Back to work.
