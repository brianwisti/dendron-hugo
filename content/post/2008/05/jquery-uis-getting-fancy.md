title: Jquery UI's Getting Fancy

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is my favorite [JavaScript]({{< relref "/card/javascript.md" >}}) library by a long shot. It provides a straightforward approach to manipulating page elements. The [JQuery UI](https://ui.jquery.com/) makes it even better (so much shiny). I'm looking forward to using it in future projects.

Sadly, I need to hunker down at work and get back to my [YUI][yui] stuff. YUI's nice, but more complex than JQuery. I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth the extra overhead, or if I'm missing some way to make things easier.
