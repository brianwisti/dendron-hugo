Outlining a post about my Notes experiment. Learned that [\_why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) coined [Tumblelog]({{< relref "/card/tumblelog.md" >}}), which is sort of what the notes are. And then I wanted to make this note. With the foxes. But I couldn't find a nice big version. So I made a nice big version. It's [Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/), just like the original. You can use it.

Go read the [Poignant Guide](https://poignant.guide/) when you have time. I put [CLOSURE](https://github.com/steveklabnik/CLOSURE) on my list.
