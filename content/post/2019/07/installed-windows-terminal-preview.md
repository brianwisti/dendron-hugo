*inbox.windows* partition is [Fast Ring](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/how-to-overview/) now, but that took the full night. All I had time for this morning was installing the fancy – and [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/master/LICENSE)! – [terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-microsoft-store-preview-release/) preview from the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

I'll finish breaking my computer after work. BTW, still figuring out build numbers but I don't think Windows Insider builds are required to install the terminal preview. May 2019 update *should* be fine.
