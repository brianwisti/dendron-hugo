Getting work done on one machine, trying [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) with [KDE]({{< relref "/card/kde.md" >}}) on the other. I got used to [GNOME Shell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell), which also means I got used to how slow it is. KDE's pretty heavy-weight too, but so much snappier.
