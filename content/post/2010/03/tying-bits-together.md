I'm working on tying together the blog and my site. A little [JQuery](http://jquery.com) magic expands the [RSS]({{< relref "/card/rss.md" >}}) feed of the [Blogger]({{< relref "/card/blogger.md" >}}) blog for visitors to [Coolnamehere]({{< relref "/card/coolnamehere.md" >}}). I'll improve the integration over time, probably by adjusting the template used for the blog. Meanwhile, I have more incentive to use Blogger.

I'll probably add feeds from other services to the site, such as _Buzz_ or Twitter. I use those frequently, and they are great for the short thoughts that don't belong in either a blog post or a static page.
