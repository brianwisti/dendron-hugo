oops didn't mean to skip a whole month

## Jots

Been exploring alternate ways to process and publish these notes, with [Logseq]({{< relref "/card/logseq.md" >}}) and [Org]({{< relref "/card/org.md" >}}) as the leading options. Meanwhile I shouldn't let the site itself get too dusty. Weekly snapshots were getting boring but monthly might have been a little overkill on spacing things out.

We're going on vacation! Well, @mrs-geek is on vacation. I get to go along too, because she likes me. Got somebody to look after the house and the critters while we check out casinos, shows, and some funky art exhibits in Vegas.

It's like [Primus](https://song.link/i/927512016) says:

> Funny thing about weekends when you're unemployed: they don't mean quite so much – except you get to hang out with your working friends.

Finally on [ADHD]({{< relref "/card/adhd.md" >}}) meds for the first time in over a year. It's nice being able to think a little more clearly again. Adding a new blog post two days after restarting meds is probably not a coincidence. My hope is that this helps with the [Job Search]({{< relref "/card/job-search.md" >}}) as well, though there's been some promising movement in that domain this week.

## Bookmarks

Been a little distracted for the last couple of weeks to log many bookmarks. Good thing it's been a month since my last snapshot!
