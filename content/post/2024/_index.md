Focused on note consolidation and the job search. Not much posting.

<!--more-->

Started the year off with a little online consolidation. First, try posting regular status updates to mix in some [Tumblelog]({{< relref "/card/tumblelog.md" >}}) immediacy without flooding people's feed readers. Second, add topic notes so that [My Public Brain]({{< relref "/card/my-public-brain.md" >}}) becomes a core part of my main Web site again.
