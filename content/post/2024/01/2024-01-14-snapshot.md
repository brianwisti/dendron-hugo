## Jots

What's up?

- job hunting; check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianwisti/) if you're looking for a remote or hybrid mostly backend senior dev based near Seattle
- building [Kotlin]({{< relref "/card/kotlin.md" >}}) and [Kubernetes]({{< relref "/card/kubernetes.md" >}}) familiarity for some specific job prospects; I could see enjoying Kotlin, and I'm starting to understand how and when Kubernetes is useful; I remain a fan of small tools when reasonable, though
- working towards a new public brain by creating an [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}) vault from this site and pulling recurring concepts into topic cards

## Plan

What's coming up next week?

- [Job Search]({{< relref "/card/job-search.md" >}}) is the priority, won't bother you with the search / submit / follow-up task list
- plan out how to build a new version of the site that would include posts and public cards, including pre-processing for posts that are integrated with Obsidian's Markdown extras and automated testing of the results

## Bookmarks

Kind of a theme this week. One might even call it a mood.

[I miss human curation](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/)
: Cassidy's correct that the human-curated Web is still here — I mean hello it me — and also correct that it's a lot harder to find thanks to algorithm-driven social networks and search engines; guess we'll have to go back to old-fashioned ways like blogrolls, webrings, bookmark pages, and variations like this weekly review

[The robots will make us more human » Nieman Journalism Lab](https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/12/the-robots-will-make-us-more-human/)
: predicting that more LLM spam and the "AI" boom in general will result in more people splitting off from the old big social networks and platforms, being more creative to differentiate between the plausible mediocrity generated by automated systems; I would love for it to be true

[7 Guiding Principles for Working with LLMs - The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/7-guiding-principles-for-working-with-llms/)
: TL;DR: Think out loud; Never trust, always verify; Use a team of assistants; Ask for choral explanations; Outsource pattern recognition; Automate transformations; Learn by doing

[W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/ethical-web-principles/)
: "The web should be a platform that helps people and provides a positive social benefit" says it all really; A W3C spec draft on building the Web we want to be in
