Mostly working on the brain-blog hybrid.

<!--more-->

## Jots

- Almost done with my brain-blog hybrid project, merging [My Public Brain]({{< relref "/card/my-public-brain.md" >}}) with [Random Geekery]({{< relref "/card/random-geekery.md" >}}).
- Made some forward progress on the current [Job Search]({{< relref "/card/job-search.md" >}}). Nothing concrete yet, but people want to talk to me. That feels nice.

## Plan

- shift the live site from blog to brain-blog
- ever forward with job search

## Bookmarks

A fair bit of [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}) stuff got my attention this week as I worked out ways to publish the vault within my own very particular workflow. BTW I'd just use Obsidian Publish if I wasn't me.

 [rehype-obsidian-callout - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-obsidian-callout)
 : support callouts (notes, warnings, etc) in remark-based SSGs

 [remark-obsidian - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-obsidian)
 : converts most of Obsidian's markup, though right now it strips out path information when slugifying links (`/card/ADHD` becomes `/cardadhd`)

[GitHub - zoni/obsidian-export: Rust library and CLI to export an Obsidian vault to regular Markdown](https://github.com/zoni/obsidian-export)
: handy for exporting Obsidian vaults; does not yet handle callouts or YouTube embeds; I ended up settling on [obsidian-export]({{< relref "/card/obsidian-export.md" >}}) + some post-processing for my current publishing workflow

[Can You See The Red Flags Of A Toxic Tech Company? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNbWmjGNZD8)
: this will always be relevant; some good general indicators, but the vaguest-sounding one to "trust your gut" is the one I've regretted ignoring over the years
