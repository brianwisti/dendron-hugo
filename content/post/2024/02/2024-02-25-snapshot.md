## Jots

We went to a kickboxing class this week! That was fun.

Other than that, applying for jobs, setting up interviews, poking at [Ruby]({{< relref "/card/ruby/_index.md" >}}) and [Crystal]({{< relref "/card/crystal.md" >}}) for some utility scripts, and trying little experiments to see if any other [PKM]({{< relref "/card/pkm.md" >}}) might work as well or better than what I've got going on with [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}). I do most daily capturing in [Logseq]({{< relref "/card/logseq.md" >}}), but so far my strict namespace requirements are a little more challenging without help from plugins.
