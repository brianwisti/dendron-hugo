My site does well enough with [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}) and a custom theme, but I wanted to explore the [themes repository](https://themes.gohugo.io). So I wrote some [Python]({{< relref "/card/python.md" >}}).

If you followed the [HugoQuickstart](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/) then you probably already have your own copy of the themes to use. Otherwise you might want to clone the [hugoThemes](https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes/) repo with git.

```console
cd mysite/
git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/spf13/hugoThemes.git themes
```

## Code

The idea here is to ask Hugo to build and serve the site once for each theme. For each built theme, ask the browser to load and screenshot the site with that theme.

I chose Python for this task. No special reason. I was just in a Python mood that day.

[Splinter](https://splinter.readthedocs.org) provided the browser controlling API. Since I’m using Chrome for this, I installed the [Chrome WebDriver](https://splinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/drivers/chrome.html). The [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/subprocess.html) standard library module allowed me to control Hugo, restarting with a fresh theme once the browser had enough time to grab a screenshot.

Then I had a last minute idea: use the [convert](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) utility from[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/index.php) to collect all the screenshots into an animated GIF.

You may need to install dependencies. Everything you need *should* be
available for your platform, but I still need to double check that. Here
are the steps I followed to get things working with
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on my Mac.

```console
brew install python3 imagemagick chromedriver
pip3 install splinter
```

All right - that’s out of the way. Now for some code.

```python{title="show-themes.py"}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os
import os.path
import shutil
import subprocess
import time

from splinter import Browser

def is_theme_dir(folder, item):
    if item[0] == '.':
        return False
    full_path = os.path.join(folder, item)
    if os.path.isfile(full_path):
        return False

    return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    theme_dir = "themes"
    screenshot_dir = "screenshots"
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:1313"

    # Clean up old screenshots
    for f in os.listdir(screenshot_dir):
        filepath = os.path.join(screenshot_dir, f)
        try:
            if os.path.isfile(filepath):
                os.unlink(filepath)
        except Exception as e:
            print(filepath, e)

    listing = [ item for item in os.listdir(theme_dir)
            if is_theme_dir(theme_dir, item) ]
    browser_name = 'chrome'
    browser = Browser(browser_name)
    browser.visit(url) # visit out here, reload down there because browser cache

    for theme in listing:
        command = [ "/usr/local/bin/hugo", "server", "--theme", theme ]
        hugo = subprocess.Popen(command)
        time.sleep(1) # More than enough time for Hugo to build the site.
        browser.reload()
        time.sleep(2) # Allow browser to get external resources.
        message = "Theme: {}, Status: {}".format(theme, browser.status_code)
        print(message)
        screenshot_name = "{}-{}.".format(browser_name, theme)
        screenshot_file = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), screenshot_dir, screenshot_name)
        browser.screenshot(screenshot_file)
        print("Screenshot saved as: {}".format(screenshot_file))
        hugo.kill()
    browser.quit()

    # Make an animated GIF of the whole thing.
    convert_command = [ "/usr/local/bin/convert",
            "-delay",  '50',
            "-loop",    '0',
            "-scale", '50%',
            "screenshots/*.png",
            "hugo-themes.gif" ]
    subprocess.run(convert_command)
```

## The Result

Aside from a few dozen PNG files? Well, there’s that nifty animation. Animated GIFs give me a headache sometimes, so I will [link to the GIF](/attachments/img/2016/hugo-themes.gif) instead.

## Observations

I noticed a few things with this experiment.

### Configuration

![Red Lounge theme](assets/img/2016/chrome-redlounge-medium.png "Red Lounge Theme")

Themes vary significantly in their expected configuration options. Some want social media links under `author`. Others wanted them in `Params`. `gravatarHash` and `GravatarHash` are two distinct options. Many have hard-coded assumptions in their layouts: an image file `/img/avatar.jpg`, for example. Sometimes it’s called `/media/me.jpg` though.

This is not an issue if you pick a favorite from the themes repository and make your site work with your favorite. It *is* an issue if you’re looking at your site in every theme. I turned my `config.yaml` into sort of a mess to make it work with more of the themes.

### Layout

Although many themes focus on blog content, some have a different purpose. Their authors may have created them with project documentation, portfolios, or company sites in mind. Their structure is more complex or requires metadata beyond a simple blog.

I like this variety. I find that it’s much easier to create sites with different purposes using Hugo than when using Jekyll.

![Artists Theme](assets/img/2016/chrome-artists-medium.png "Artists theme")

But it does help understand why sometimes the site renders as an attractive blank space in my preview. Examining the theme README would be a good next step if a particular theme interested me.

Well - reading documentation for the thing you’re using is generally a good idea anyways.

### Sections

![Pixyll theme](assets/img/2016/chrome-pixyll-medium.png "Pixyll theme")

The themes seemed a little confused by my Craft section. Some ignored craft projects completely. Others integrated them with posts on the `index.html` listing. Most at least provided a menu link to the section. And yes, the theme `README` would likely remove my confusion.

You will probably need to [customize your template](http://gohugo.io/themes/customizing/) if you have special content.

## What Theme Should I Use?

Maybe you were wondering which theme you could use for your new site. I suggest [Hyde-X](http://themes.gohugo.io/hyde-x/) for blog sites. It has nice defaults, and provides quality documentation for its many configuration options. My site started with Hyde-X as a base before moving in its own direction.

![Hyde-X theme](assets/img/2016/chrome-hyde-x-medium.png "Hyde-X theme")

Hyde-X isn’t the only way to start. There are numerous excellent blog-focused themes in the repository.

For non-blog sites? I don’t know, to be honest. None of my content worked well with those. Good luck with your search\!

Anyways, the important thing is to have fun.
