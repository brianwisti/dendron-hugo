Watching [YAPCNA](http://www.yapcna.org) videos, and the most important to me today had nothing to do with [Perl]({{< relref "/card/perl.md" >}}). I loved  [Ed Finkler](https://funkatron.com)'s talk about mental health among developers. His [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org) project - Open Sourcing Mental Illness - aims to improve workplace and community awareness and resources for mental health. Good stuff. Many domains and communities need this effort,
and his chosen community is tech. Worth checking out.
