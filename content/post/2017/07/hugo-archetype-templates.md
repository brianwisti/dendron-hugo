I try out archetype templates from the [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}) static site generator, smoothing the
whole thing into my workflow with a bash script.

## Hugo Archetypes

[Hugo archetypes](http://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/) are templates that Hugo uses when you tell it to create new content. Hugo allows both default archetypes and [section archetypes](http://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/#section-archetypes) for content that belongs in a particular section (such as Posts or Crafts).

As of release [v0.24](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.24), archetypes are full templates. You can use [variables](http://gohugo.io/templates/variables/) and [functions](http://gohugo.io/templates/functions/)  to fine-tune details of your archetype. This gives me a chance to simplify my content creation workflow.

### My Default Archetype Template

My archetype focuses on [front matter](http://gohugo.io/content/front-matter/). Since the site sections share taxonomy rules, I use a single default archetype.

**`archetypes/default.md`**

```markdown
---
title: "{{ replace .TranslationBaseName "-" " " | title }}"
date: {{ dateFormat "2006-01-02" .Date }}
year: "{{ dateFormat "2006" .Date }}"
draft: true
tags:
-
categories:
-

tl;dr
<!-- more -->
```

* Hugo provides `title` and `date` if you leave them out. My `title` looks the   same as the default, but I add it to the template to remember what   transformations are being done.
* I prefer a specific format for date in my front matter, so I add my own   version.
* I use a `year` taxonomy for archives.
* Everything is a `draft` until I specify otherwise.
* All my content should be tagged and categorized.
* I try to summarize the post in an initial paragraph that gets shown in list   views.
* That last line is really <code>&#60;&#33;&#45;&#45;more&#45;&#45;&#62;</code>  with no spaces, but if I skip the spaces here Hugo thinks I want another summary block in this post.

That's good enough for `hugo new`. Since I have `newContentEditor` set to "vim" in my [config](http://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/), Hugo opens the new file in my editor after creating it.

```bash
  hugo new post/2017/23-things-i-hate-about-lists.md
```

My workflow is a little more complicated than "create a draft and edit it" though.

## My Workflow

I create and edit site content in its own git branch. With multiple drafts going at any one time, using separate branches lets me focus on the current content.

I follow these steps every time I add a new post.

1. Create a branch
2. Add a draft content file
3. Start editing the draft file!

I can ignore the publishing part of the workflow for today, which involves running some tests and pushing to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). That deserves its own post.

I originally automated this with a small Ruby script which would create the branch and generate a content file for me. The file generating code is not needed now that Hugo archetypes are templates. My small, slightly clunky Ruby script can be replaced with a smaller, hopefully less clunky [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

**`scripts/add`**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# stricter bash
#  see http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'

SECTION=${1:-}
TITLE=${2:-}

if [[ -z "$SECTION" || -z "$TITLE" ]]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 SECTION TITLE"
  exit 1
fi

TITLE_SLUG="$(echo -n "$TITLE" | sed -e 's/[^[:alnum:]]/-/g' | tr -s '-' | tr A-Z a-z)"
YEAR="$(date +"%Y")"
STUB="$SECTION/$YEAR/$TITLE_SLUG"

git checkout -b "$STUB"
hugo new "$STUB.md"
# newContentEditor set in Hugo config, expect Vim here.
```

Applying details like [unofficial strict mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) is part my process for getting more comfortable scripting Bash. The bit that's important to me: this script fails loudly on encountering bad variables and bad processes.

The fun little slug-generating `sed` and `tr` pipe came directly from [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/). I know that I will lose punctuation and unusual capitalization between this and Hugo's manipulation of `.TranslationBaseName`. It encourages me to keep titles simple. The title can edited in the front matter later if it is that important to me.

[`date`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/date-invocation.html#date-invocation) comes from [GNU Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html#Top). I knew I could use `date` to get a simple description of the date. I recently discovered that it also accepts a format string! Turns out that GNU Coreutils gives the shell quite a bit of functionality that I usually ran to some programming language and its libraries for. Being self-taught produces weird gaps in my knowledge.

```console
$ ./script/add post "23 Things I Hate About Lists"
Switched to a new branch 'post/2017/23-things-i-hate-about-lists'
/home/brian/Sites/rgb-hugo/content/post/2017/23-things-i-hate-about-lists.md created
```

Excuse me while I go write my masterpiece. Have fun!
