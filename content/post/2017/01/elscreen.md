I use [ElScreen](https://github.com/knu/elscreen/) every time I open [Emacs]({{< relref "/card/emacs.md" >}}). May as well make a quick note about it.

I admit it. I’m still more of a [Vim]({{< relref "/card/vim.md" >}}) user. The workflow I’m used to is Vim with some tabs, usually sitting in a [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) session. When in Emacs I use ElScreen, which basically gives me tmux inside Emacs.

If you know what that means, great. If not, then pretend ElScreen is a weird way to make emacs a tabbed editor.

## Install It

[ErgoEmacs](http://ergoemacs.org/) has a nice [guide](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_package_system.html) to using the Emacs package manager. With that as your guide, find and install the [elscreen package](https://melpa.org/#/elscreen) from [MELPA](https://melpa.org/).

Start ElScreen in your init file.

```elisp
(elscreen-start)
```

Now the elscreen commands are available throughout your Emacs session.

## Use It

[ElScreen Usage](https://github.com/knu/elscreen#usage) shows *many* commands for ElScreen. I manage with just a few.

| Function            | Keys       | Description |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `elscreen-create`   | `Ctrl+z c` | Create a new screen and switch to it.
| `elscreen-next`     | `Ctrl+z n` | Cycle to the next screen
| `elscreen-previous` | `Ctrl+z p` | Cycle to the previous screen
| `elscreen-kill`     | `Ctrl+z k` | Kill the current screen
| `elscreen-help`     | `Ctrl+z ?` | Show ElScreen key bindings

I know. A tutorial or something would be nice. But every time I start to write a tutorial for something, I think of one more detail that hasn't been covered and the cycle starts all over again on the new detail. Just needed *something* here so I could shut my brain up about "why don't you mention ElScreen?"
