Notes on saving screenshots in OS X, so I don’t have to look it up again.

<!--more-->

This started as a search to find how I can set the OS screenshot save location. [OS X Daily](http://osxdaily.com/) provided that information and much more. I suggest you check it out for your OS X tips.

## The Shortcuts I Use

My fingers pretty much have these memorized, but it would be nice if my brain knew them too.

| Keys                           | Action |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| `⌘ + ⇧ + 3`                    | Save full screen to file
| `⌘ + ⇧ + 4` + select area      | Save selected area to file
| `⌘ + ⇧ + 4` + spacebar + click | Save selected window to file

There are [several more](http://osxdaily.com/2010/06/09/screen-capture-in-mac-os-x/) that I do not use. I'm already trying to learn Emacs shortcuts. I don't feel like cluttering my brain with additional OS X shortcuts I won't use.

## Setting The Save Location

OS X saves these files to `~/Desktop` by default, which results in much visual clutter on my screen desktop. Eventually I tired of the periodic cleanups and learned how to save in a different folder.

```bash
mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots
defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/Screenshots/
```

OS X Daily [suggested](http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/26/change-the-screenshot-save-file-location-in-mac-os-x/) changing the setting and running `killall SystemUIServer`. Somewhere in the years since that post was published, restarting SystemUIServer became unnecessary.
