I've been experimenting with several excellent editors for Windows, including [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com) and [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com). The experiments will continue, but for now I am going to stick to a Windows install of [Vim]({{< relref "/card/vim.md" >}}). Becoming familiar with Windows doesn't mean I have to drop everything I already know in the dust!
