Here's my [TIL]({{< relref "/card/til.md" >}}) for [Ruby]({{< relref "/card/ruby/_index.md" >}}). When you override a method in a subclass, you also need to redeclare any aliases for that method. Seems pretty obvious when you think about it. I didn't think about it, though, and it caught me up for a few minutes.

I'd post a block of sample code, but I keep getting `"body, Malformed HTML found."`
errors from [43 Things]({{< relref "/card/43-things.md" >}}) whenever I try to save with my code in there (`pre` tags and
all)
