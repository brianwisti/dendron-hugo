![a page from my public brain](assets/img/2023/cover-2023-03-09.jpg "I did just enough to have something I could publish")

> [My Public Brain]({{< relref "/card/my-public-brain.md" >}}) is no longer a separate site, so whatever kind of brain I'm willing to show the world is right here.

Decided to start putting my raw notes online. Okay not *raw* raw. Still gonna be some filtering for content. But ye gods it is raw in the sense of being very rough.

I set up a new [Dendron]({{< relref "/card/dendron.md" >}}) vault, used [Astro]({{< relref "/card/astro.md" >}}) to build a site from it, and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host the site. Netlify is synced up to the repo. Since [GitDoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc) is enabled to commit and push every minute, my brain should stay fresh with minimal effort on my part.

That seems like a good thing, generally.
