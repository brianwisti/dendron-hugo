In case you want to make your own spin on [Sable](https://www.shed-works.co.uk/sable). It's not *exactly* [Moebius](https://www.creativebloq.com/illustration/how-moebius-revolutionised-comic-art-21514203), but dang close. With some tweaks your game could be styled closer to [Matt Howarth](https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/howarth_matt.htm) or [John Findley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Arcana).

Sometimes the YouTube recommendations work out okay.
