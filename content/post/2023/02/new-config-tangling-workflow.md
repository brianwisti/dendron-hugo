I had to refresh my [Config]({{< relref "/config/_index.md" >}}) pages. I had to refresh how my config is generated. Why not do both at the same time?

So now I've got [Yarner]({{< relref "/card/yarner.md" >}}) tangling Markdown sources for the whole thing. Even the dotbot config.

Sometimes I go too far. Doesn't mean I'll stop.
