Took a break this weekend knitting a quick yarn project.

The [original pattern](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-f-bomb) uses [duplicate stitch knitting](https://www.wikihow.com/Knit-the-Duplicate-Stitch) for the letter, but after a couple frustrated hours I gave up on that and crocheted the letter on. I expect to make more of these. The lettering should improve.
