I crocheted another "Boy Beanie" from [Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57512.Stitch_n_Bitch_Crochet). This time I followed the pattern!

See, I left one of the hats from [A Couple Crocheted Hats]({{< relref "/post/2018/02/a-couple-crocheted-hats.md" >}}) at a friend's place, where somebody promptly "borrowed" it. I liked the hat better on them, and made another for myself.

Crocheting this took me under four hours, including a break to walk the dog. I impress myself.

Well I have to impress *somebody.* Why not me?
