The "Anarchy Irony Hat" would have turned out better if I understood satin stitch. I think I got it now. But this has a certain goofy charm.

The gray and black "Boy Beanie" came out much nicer, even with my intentional variations from the book. I doubt I could follow a pattern to the letter even if I wrote the pattern myself.

I think that's it! I'm all caught up on finished yarn projects. Time to write about other stuff. And knit, of course.
