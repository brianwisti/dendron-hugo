I still aspire to learn [amigurumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amigurumi).

This time I crocheted two balls, referencing the [same video](https://youtu.be/mJ47MLlrLzw) as the [Amigurumi Ball Thing]({{< relref "/post/2015/03/amigurumi-ball-thing.md" >}}). Today I put faces on them. My first projects with googly eyes or embroidery floss. I must assume I will improve at both.
