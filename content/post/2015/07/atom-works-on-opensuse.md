Thought I'd try the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) on my [openSUSE](http://opensuse.org) Tumbleweed install.

RPMs and DEB files are available from the Atom site, and the RPM works just fine for me. There's the Markdown for [Ruby iTunes Ratings Fun]({{< relref "/post/2015/03/ruby-itunes-ratings-fun.md" >}}), a live preview, and some sort of Git integration showing up in the sidebar.

Since I'm more of a [Vim]({{< relref "/card/vim.md" >}}) person, I don't really know what to do with Atom just yet. I may end up not doing much of anything with it. But at least I  now it works. Go ahead and try it out if you're curious.
