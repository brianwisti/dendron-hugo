I enjoyed importing the [Coolnamehere]({{< relref "/card/coolnamehere.md" >}}) content so much last weekend that I decided to import the posts from a neglected [Blogger]({{< relref "/card/blogger.md" >}}) blog this weekend. [jekyll-import](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/) simplified the actual import process, though I still had a lot of manual cleanup to perform.

The footer now includes links to *All Categories* and *All Posts*. The main category listing in the header was pared back down to the stuff I expect to update. I need to do something with the full post listing. It is unwieldy  now. Time to look up [Jekyll]({{< relref "/card/jekyll.md" >}}) plugins.

I don’t know what to do with the material still hosted on Blogspot. Do I delete it? Do I make each post redirect here? I’ll figure it out.

I looked at the number of visitors to that blog since 2006 — not many — and opted to delete it rather than spend any time messing with redirects.

Why do this in the first place? I got bored of having pages I wrote more or less for myself being scattered here, there, and everywhere. It’s a little easier to remember what I’ve learned if I keep it in one place.

I also have my old LiveJournal posts, but they may end up staying offline. They lack programming content and serve mainly as an insight into how profoundly depressed I was up to about 2009 or so. Not *especially* excited about reviewing that content at the moment.
