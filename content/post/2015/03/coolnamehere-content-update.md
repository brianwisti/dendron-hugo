I got bored of the old [Coolnamehere]({{< relref "/card/coolnamehere.md" >}})  pages effectively sitting outside of the site because of the way [Jekyll]({{< relref "/card/jekyll.md" >}}) — and pretty much every other static blogging system — treats pages as secondary to posts. It makes sense, anyways. Once you stop bikeshedding about where to put content in your elaborate directory structure, it gets easier to add stuff.

So with a bit of Ruby code, some time attempting to correct publishing dates on [archive.org](http://archive.org), scrubbing repeatedly over internal links with [linkchecker](http://wummel.github.io/linkchecker/), and heavy usage of the [jekyll-pageless-redirects](https://github.com/nquinlan/jekyll-pageless-redirects) plugin, the important content of the site has a consistent presentation.

Click around to satisfy your historic curiosity.

And *of course* there are still going to be issues with that old content.
