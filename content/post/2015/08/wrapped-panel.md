I like this one.

![line drawing of celtic knotwork panel and fluid geometric repeats](assets/img/2015/cover-2015-08-08.png)

Started as basic Celtic knotwork practice the other day. Put aside because I thought it needed more, but had no idea. Picked it up this morning and apparently had ideas.

That little circle in the corner is me getting a sudden urge to try some [George Bain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bain_(artist)) style construction. It - well - it's not exactly what I saw in my head, but it looks cool.
