I know it's a silly name. See, I found a [pattern site](http://doctorwhoscarf.com) for scarves from the [Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who) TV show. <http://doctorwhoscarf.com> contains great patterns and solid advice throughout. This scarf uses the pattern for the [original scarf](http://www.doctorwhoscarf.com/s12.html), with some differences.

- I replaced the original scarf colors with an assortment of greens.
- It's only about 75% of the knitted rows from the pattern.

With those differences, it hardly seemed fair calling it a "Doctor Who" scarf.
