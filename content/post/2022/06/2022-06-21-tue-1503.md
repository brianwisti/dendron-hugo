I'm not dead yet! Site wasn't updating because Netlify failed with an `exit code 2`. Bit vague. Finally had a few minutes to look closer.

<!--more-->

Turns out it's because I've been keeping up locally with [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}) releases and syntax changes, but not telling Netlify. They need the same version of Hugo that I use.

So now I've got a basic `netlify.toml` based on [Netlify Hugo docs](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/hugo/).

```toml
[build]
  command = "hugo"
  publish = "public"

[build.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = "0.101.0"
```

Looks like everything is good again.
