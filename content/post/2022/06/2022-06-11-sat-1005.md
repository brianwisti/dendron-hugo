Got Org Babel playing nice with TypeScript thanks to [ob-typescript](https://github.com/lurdan/ob-typescript). It's a wild Saturday morning here.

![Emacs showing an org mode note](assets/img/2022-06-11-emacs-typescript.png "Takes a bit to get there on WSL but the code *does* run")

<!--more-->

That required a few more lines in my config, but not *too* many.

```lisp
(use-package ob-typescript)
(use-package org
  ;; ...
  :config
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
    '((typescript . t))))
```

I also followed my own advice from [[2022-05-12 Thu 23:02]]({{< relref "/post/2022/05/2022-05-12-thu-2302.md" >}}), and added [Tide](https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide) for TypeScript support in Emacs. Just copied and pasted from all the links, so config's a bit of a mess.

Oh hey that's right I still need to take my ADHD meds. I'll go do that now.
