Meanwhile, in [Obsidian]({{< relref "/card/obsidian.md" >}}):

[Logseq]({{< relref "/card/logseq.md" >}}) is great. Native outlining, org-like tasks, the power of [Datalog](http://www.learndatalogtoday.org). But Obsidian has the [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) plugin. What you feed it looks a lot like SQL.

```dataview
TABLE
  length(rows) as "Notes"
from ""
where isa != null
GROUP BY isa
SORT isa ASC
```

I kinda know SQL already. Enough to know what to look up to make a table of note types.

| Group       | Notes   |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Book        | 3       |
| Game        | 5       |
| Meeting     | 1       |
| Movie       | 1       |
| Package     | 1       |
| Person      | 41      |
| Pet         | 4       |
| Project     | 1       |
| Source Note | 16      |

Nope. Haven't settled on One True Note System and I likely never will. But at least I'm enjoying myself.
