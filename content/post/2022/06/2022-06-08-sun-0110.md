Trying to finish at least one book before I give in to the temptation to buy [Roguelike Development with JavaScript](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-6059-3) based on an [enthusiastic review](https://www.matthewhughes.co.uk/roguelike-development-andre-garzia-review/) by [Matthew Hughes](https://www.matthewhughes.co.uk).

Also it's after 1am here and I should go to bed. Just wanted to read that tab before I closed it, and now I'm all "ooh that sounds good."

anyways goodnight
