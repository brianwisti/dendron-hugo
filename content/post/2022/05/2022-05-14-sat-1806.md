[Sneakers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/) is one of my favorite movies, so of course I enjoyed [Cracking the Code: Sneakers at 30](https://letterboxd.com/journal/cracking-the-code-sneakers/).

> It’s arguably the best film about the internet ever made, and it came out before the internet as we know it was even really a thing. The word ‘internet’ isn’t even uttered.
