title: '[2022-05-21 Sat 17:44]  My basic org-roam-dailies capture template'
updated: '2024-02-11 17:22:35'

Just a really mild adjustment to the [org-roam-dailies](https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#org_002droam_002ddailies) "sane default configuration." Main difference is an inactive timestamp like I have for the tumblelog --- I like having a chronology --- and some file tags.

```elisp
(setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
      '(("j" "Jot" entry "* %U %?"
         :target (file+head "%<%Y-%m-%d>.org"
                            "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n#+filetags: %<:%Y:%B>\n")
         :unarrowed t)))
```

I may go past this with specific templates for tasks and bookmarks. But first I need to make sure this basic setup works for me.
