Trying to use [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}) and [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) to have sort of a [Tumblelog]({{< relref "/card/tumblelog.md" >}}) with [Org]({{< relref "/card/org.md" >}}).

What's a tumblelog? Just kind of a stream-of-consciousness blog. Might have recurring topics. Might not. Posts might have titles. They might not. Might be short notes. Might be long essays.

Why? Inspired by the [Rachel Quickblogge](https://rachel.live). Course she did hers the smart and quick way, using WordPress. But I gotta be me, and [overthinking](https://www.oglaf.com/trapmaster/) it is what I do best.

Looks nice, yes? Starting with the familiar [Hyde](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hyde/) theme. Going on vacation now, so it may take me a few days to turn this project into a proper mess.
