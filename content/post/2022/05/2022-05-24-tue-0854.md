Brain insists on a CLI flow for this tumblelog. So of course I have to mess up my perfectly functional flow.

<!--more-->

I know I'll fiddle with it more later, but here's what I got at the moment.

I consider the Org inactive timestamps title core to the tumblelog flow. Better let [`time.Format`](https://gohugo.io/functions/dateformat/) produce something plausible in my `posts.md` Hugo archetype.

```md
---
title: "[{{ time.Format "2006-01-02 Mon 15:04" .Date }}]"
author:
- Brian Wisti
date: {{ .Date }}
tags: []
draft: false
---
```

The archetype uses [YAML]({{< relref "/card/yaml.md" >}}) frontmatter instead of [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co)'s default [TOML]({{< relref "/card/toml.md" >}}). I find manually managing the tags is easier that way.

My brain picked [Ruby]({{< relref "/card/ruby/_index.md" >}}) for the script to generate and open a new post, thanks mainly to the convenience of Piotr Murach's [TTY toolkit](https://ttytoolkit.org).

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require "tty-command"
require "tty-editor"

POST_PATH = "content/posts/%Y/%m/%s.md"

post_path = Time.now.strftime POST_PATH
cmd = TTY::Command.new
cmd.run "hugo new #{post_path}"

TTY::Editor.open post_path
```

All it does is ask Hugo to create a new post based on the archetype, and then open that post file in my `$EDITOR`.

I'll get to more later. I know from past experience I can use `tty-command` to manage the git bits after I'm done writing.

But apparently if I want to pay rent I need to *work*.
