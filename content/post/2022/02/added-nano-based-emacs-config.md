A *lot* of fiddling with [Emacs]({{< relref "/card/emacs.md" >}}) today. Thought I'd try something not so much "vanilla" as on fewer predetermined rails than the average [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) config.

This new config starts from [nano-emacs](https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs), a rather streamlined setup. Of *course* I enjoyed cluttering it up.
