Woke up, saw a [Planet Crafter](https://playtheplanetcrafter.com) update, trying to find out what it is, grumbling about there being no announcement.

Oh wait I think that's because they were still typing it.

<!--more-->

Announcement timestamped eight minutes before I started writing this and roughly one minute after I woke up.

Copied and pasted.

I think maybe they're still waking up too.

Here's the preview for visual folks.
