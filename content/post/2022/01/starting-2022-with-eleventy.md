Finally ported enough of my site to [Eleventy]({{< relref "/card/eleventy.md" >}}) that I feel like making it live. It's only been two and a half years since I started thinking about this in *thinking|pub.post.2019.04.ooh-eleventy* . Why rush into things, right?

<!--more-->

## But why?

Well, Eleventy's got [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) support, for starters. For the Pythonistas out there, Nunjucks is basically [Jinja](https://jinja2docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Node.js.

Beyond that, the Node.js ecosystem is pretty lively, with plenty to keep the dedicated *ssg-is-for-putterers|putterer* occupied for a bit. Eleventy can hook into enough of that without going overboard on the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.com) application side of things. A gentle transition.

## This isn't even my final form

Nowhere near what I'd call "done." There's still things to touch up with the Eleventy site. Layout, workflow, architecture.

And naturally I'm already casting glances at other SSGs like [Lume](https://lumeland.github.io). I haven't abandoned the [Astro]({{< relref "/card/astro.md" >}}) experiment either. I'm just waiting for Astro to be a little quicker at assembling a site like mine.

I just really really wanted to stop complaining about [Hugo]({{< relref "/card/hugo.md" >}}). It's great. It really is. It just hasn't felt like a good fit for my particular flow in the last couple years.
