Been wanting to list at least some of the sites I follow. Blog discovery is almost as hard as finding a six month old tweet. [Recent events](https://www.techdirt.com/2022/04/26/twitters-legal-team-has-been-an-aggressive-defender-of-free-speech-will-that-continue-under-musk/ ) add some urgency to the thought.

So [Neighborhood]({{< relref "/page/neighborhood.md" >}}) is me doing my part to help. Right now itâ€™s just a slightly tweaked export of my [Fraidycat](https://fraidyc.at ) feed, fed into a Hugo [data template](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/#data-driven-content).
