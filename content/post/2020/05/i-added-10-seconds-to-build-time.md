I finally have year/month archives on my site. Bookmarked a [post](https://blog.atj.me/2017/10/generate-yearly-and-monthly-archive-pages-with-hugo-sections/) on the topic by [Adam Jarret](https://blog.atj.me/) a while back. Finally did it. In Perl, though. Not Node.js.

The build time problem comes from following his template logic - based on a Jekyll plugin. Got some ideas, but they'll wait. Now it's bedtime.
