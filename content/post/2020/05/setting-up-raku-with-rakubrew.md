title: Setting up Raku with Rakubrew

Rakudobrew changed its name since last I looked

<!--more-->

I was avoiding Rakudobrew for some now-forgotten technical reason.  Probably couldn’t get a particular Perl 6 release to build.  But I’m tired of one-off scripts or distribution packages that don’t quite match my expectations. What’s new in the Perl 6 language manager world?

For starters, names have changed.  Perl 6 has been [Raku]({{< relref "/card/raku.md" >}}) for a little bit, and Rakudobrew is now [Rakubrew](https://rakubrew.org/).

I don’t recall enough about Rakudobrew to make a better or worse comparison. Let’s just install it and see how it works.

Unfortunately `curl` doesn’t like the rakubrew site.

``` text
$ curl https://rakubrew.org/install-on-perl.sh | sh
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: certificate has expired
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not
establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and
how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above.
```

Firefox thinks the site’s fine, though.  I’ll download `install-on-perl.sh` and run it locally.  Oh nice, shell initialization instructions specific to the shell I’m running.

```console
$ sh ~/Downloads/install-on-perl.sh
Downloading rakubrew...
Installing rakubrew to /home/random/.rakubrew ...

Load rakubrew automatically in `zsh` by adding

  eval "$(/home/random/.rakubrew/bin/rakubrew init Zsh)"

to ~/.zshrc.
This can be easily done using:

  echo 'eval "$(/home/random/.rakubrew/bin/rakubrew init Zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

I do not yet have rakubrew on all my machines, but I *do* have nearly the same config everywhere.  The logic I want looks a little more like this.

``` bash{title="~/.zshenv"}
export RAKUBREW_HOME=``$HOME/.rakubrew''

if [ -d "$RAKUBREW_HOME" ]; then
    eval "$($RAKUBREW_HOME/bin/rakubrew init Zsh)"
fi
```

Time to reload my shell and see if it worked.

```console
$ rakubrew --help
Usage:
     rakubrew version          # or rakubrew current
     rakubrew versions         # or rakubrew list
     rakubrew global [version] # or rakubrew switch [<version>]
     rakubrew shell [--unset|<version>]
     rakubrew local [<version>]
     rakubrew nuke [<version>] # or rakubrew unregister [<version>]
     rakubrew rehash

     rakubrew available        # or rakubrew list-available
     rakubrew build [<backend>] [<tag>|<branch>|<sha-1>] [--configure-opts=<options>]
     rakubrew triple [<rakudo-version> [<nqp-version> [<moar-version>]]]
     rakubrew register <name> <path>
     rakubrew build-zef
     rakubrew download [<backend>] [<rakudo-version>]

     rakubrew exec <executable> [<executable-args>]
     rakubrew which <executable>
     rakubrew whence [--path] <executable>
     rakubrew mode [env|shim]
     rakubrew self-upgrade
     rakubrew init

     rakubrew test [<version>|all]

     rakubrew help [--verbose|<command>]
     rakubrew home
     rakubrew rakubrew-version
```

Apparently!  Can I install a fresh version of [Rakudo](https://rakudo.org)?

```console
$ rakubrew download
Downloading https://rakudo.org/dl/rakudo/rakudo-moar-2020.05.1-01-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
Extracting
Done, moar-2020.05.1 installed
```

Yes indeed.  Pretty quick, too.  Looks like I no longer need to do a full build every time there’s a release.  Nice.

Now make `moar-2020.05.01` the default.

```console
$ rakubrew switch moar-2020.05.1
Switching to moar-2020.05.1
```

And what can Raku tell me about itself?  I’ll recycle my one-liner from [Building Rakudo and Moarvm on Linux]({{< relref "/post/2019/11/building-rakudo-and-moarvm-on-linux.md" >}}).

```console
$ raku -e 'say "Yo, World! This is $*PERL - specifically: { ($*PERL, $*VM, $*DISTRO).map({ $_.gist })}"'
Yo, World! This is Raku - specifically: Raku (6.d) moar (2020.05) manjaro (3.10.0.514.10.2.el.7.x.86._.64)
```

Now the real test.  Can I install [perl6-readline](https://github.com/drforr/perl6-readline) via [zef](https://github.com/ugexe/zef) for the Raku REPL?

Aw man. [drforr](https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/remembering-jeff-goff) sure has cast a long shadow.  We’ll be missing him for a while.

And with that, I think I’ll sign off on this post.  Everything I needed installed cleanly, including [p6doc](https://github.com/Raku/doc) and a few other [modules](https://modules.raku.org) for puttering with the site.

Rakubrew worked!
