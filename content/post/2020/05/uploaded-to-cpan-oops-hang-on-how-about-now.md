If anything about [MojoX::Date::Local](https://metacpan.org/pod/MojoX::Date::Local) seems a bit off, that's because it's my first CPAN package. It's just [Mojo::Date](https://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojo/Date) with a tiny bit of date formatting and time zone stuff I needed in a couple projects. Not time zone *math*.

No.

God no.

Just showing local time.
