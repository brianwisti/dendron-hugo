Woke up with the terrible idea of rewriting [WebMake](http://webmake.taint.org/) as a [Gatsby]({{< relref "/card/gatsby.md" >}}) plugin but:

- I don’t even know who would know what I’m talking about
- I don’t know how to do that
- [I’m just not sure how well this plan was thought through](https://youtu.be/93B072j-E3I).
