[Emacs In a Box - Elisp Programming and Customization](https://caiorss.github.io/Emacs-Elisp-Programming/)

Maybe the bookmark should have been to the [Elisp Snippets](https://caiorss.github.io/Emacs-Elisp-Programming/Elisp_Snippets.html) page.
That's the one I keep going back to. The whole site is a well-organized collection of notes on using and extending [Emacs]({{< relref "/card/emacs.md" >}}).
