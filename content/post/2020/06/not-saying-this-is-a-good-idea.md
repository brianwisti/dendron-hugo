One big window for [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/) for a window manager. Mainly to manage maximized [Emacs]({{< relref "/card/emacs.md" >}}). There are easier ways to edit files in Windows and [WSL]({{< relref "/card/wsl.md" >}}). But it renders prettier fonts than VcXsrv with floating windows, so I think I'll keep it. After I fix all the hotkeys, of course.

I used [this post](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2017/04/16/windows-susbsystem-for-linux-xfce-4/) from [Paul Silisteanu](https://solarianprogrammer.com/) as a general guide, except `apt install awesome awesome-extra` for the awesomewm  stuff.
