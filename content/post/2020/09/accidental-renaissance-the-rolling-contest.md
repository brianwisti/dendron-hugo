Somebody posted their pic to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/e6BNB31). I saw it [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRenaissance/comments/ivxfp7/the_rolling_contest/). I spent more time scrutinizing this image than I'll admit. It's just so perfect. It couldn't *possibly* be accidental. Could it?

This is art.
