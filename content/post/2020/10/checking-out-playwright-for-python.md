From [Announcing Playwright for Python: Reliable end-to-end testing for the web](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-playwright-for-python-reliable-end-to-end-testing-for-the-web/):

> While automation is important, end-to-end tests are prone to being slow and flaky. To fix this, we released Playwright in JavaScript earlier this year and have enabled thousands of developers and testers to be successful at end-to-end testing. Today, weâ€™re bringing the same capabilities to Python.

*Almost* made it to bed at a reasonable time until a random search showed me this. I'd been glancing enviously at [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) earlier this year. Configurable, cross-browser testing from [Python]({{< relref "/card/python.md" >}})? Nice. Nicer than Selenium, anyways.

BRB rewriting all my browser tests.
