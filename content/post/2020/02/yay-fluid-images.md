Fluid images in my posts, with added `![]()` accepted syntax for the markdown content! This [Hugo community post](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/simple-image-render-hook-template-for-responsive-images/22464) covers the details.

Amusingly, I’m doing this to make it easier to convert to another system. Other site generators know what to do with standard image markup, as opposed to my custom shortcode. The key for the Big Rewrite is to keep working on what you have now. That way the Big Rewrite isn’t *quite* so big.
