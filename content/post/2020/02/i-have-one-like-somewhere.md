Been meaning to get [Webmention]({{< relref "/card/webmention.md" >}}) integration for a *while*. Went the easy way, using [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) and [brid.gy](https://brid.gy). Easier than writing everything myself.

For now itâ€™s just like counts, with a [Pyinvoke]({{< relref "/card/pyinvoke.md" >}}) task checking my mentions feed at Hugo build time. More stuff is planned, but first I decide how much information to show and from which sources. Not every tweet reply is intended as a blog comment.
