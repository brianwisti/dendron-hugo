![prematurely ended fragment of a blog post](assets/img/2020/cover-2020-02-25.png "Where's the rest of the post?")

Got a [Pyinvoke]({{< relref "/card/pyinvoke.md" >}}) `test` task for the site. Because of that, I found a post about [Making a Jekyll Collection]({{< relref "/post/2015/07/making-a-jekyll-collection.md" >}}) that got truncated â€” before the current repo existed.

Fixed it though. Got the missing content from an [old copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318224730/http://randomgeekery.org/post/2015/making-a-jekyll-collection). Yay for Internet Archive\!
