Gave them all a Universally Unique Identifer, per [RFC 4122](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc4122.html).

Should simplify rearranging the site sources. Helpful hint: don’t rely on filenames as unique content identifiers for your workflow. Oh sure they work fine 80% of the time, but that last 20% is a doozy.

I used Python’s [uuid](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html) library. There’s also the [uuidgen](http://bigdatums.net/2016/10/01/generate-uuid-linux/) command if I switch away from a Python workflow.
